# Superstore EDA

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the popular **Superstore dataset**, which contains information about customer orders, sales, profits, regions, and product categories. The goal is to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends to support data-driven business decisions.

## File

- **Superstore EDA.ipynb** â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing the entire EDA workflow including data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

## Project Objectives

- Load and explore the Superstore dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Visualize relationships between sales, profit, category, and region.
- Identify key insights and business opportunities.

## Key Analyses Performed

- Sales and Profit trends by Region, State, and City
- Category and Sub-Category-wise performance
- Impact of Discounts on Profit
- Order and Shipping patterns
- Top and bottom performing products and segments

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly` (if applicable)

## Insights & Observations

- Some sub-categories consistently perform poorly in certain regions.
- Discounts above a certain threshold tend to reduce profit margins significantly.
- Certain states have high sales but low profitability, indicating high operating costs or ineffective discounting.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if provided).
3. Open `Superstore EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Run the cells sequentially.
